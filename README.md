Learning JavaScript!

Welcome to my repository! My name is Ana Escobedo and I am taking WEB200 to help deepen my understanding of JavaScript. I have a learning disability so learning is better for me with an instructor, which is another reason why I am taking this class. I hope to use JavaScript to further my knowledge about web development in order to get an associates in science with a focus in web development. Ideally, I would love to be a back-end developer and impliment JavaScript techniques, but I am still considering what potential career options there are. I am excited to learn about how JavaScript makes web pages more interactive. 

<b>Session 2</b>
Session two was very informative for learning all about variables and expressions. I learned about how functions work and how to prompt the user to input information. Variables are containers that store values, such as let, which is followed by the variable name. A string shows up as text in the browser. While coding my JavaScript, I realized that my function for the age converter program did not function properly because I did not initialize my variables before typing in my commands. This information has very useful for me because I have learned how to collect and process the user input using operators and variables and successfully provided the user with an end result. I hope to use this information in the future to create websites designed to help users with calculating information. 

<b>Session 3</b>
<p>
    The lessons learned about functions in JavaScript were extremely helpful. I learned that functions are a set of statements that group together a particular task, it is also a way of organizing and reusing code over and over again. Parameters are the names assigned to the values inside the parenthesis, and should be relevant to whatever data is being held inside the function. The return statement will return the outcome of any data put into the function. For my assignments, I practiced using the return function to show the result of the area of different shapes. This was helpful to my current learning environment because I now understand how to return the results of different calculations.
