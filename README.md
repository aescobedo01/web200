Learning JavaScript!

Welcome to my repository! My name is Ana Escobedo and I am taking WEB200 to help deepen my understanding of JavaScript. I have a learning disability so learning is better for me with an instructor, which is another reason why I am taking this class. I hope to use JavaScript to further my knowledge about web development in order to get an associates in science with a focus in web development. Ideally, I would love to be a back-end developer and impliment JavaScript techniques, but I am still considering what potential career options there are. I am excited to learn about how JavaScript makes web pages more interactive. 

<b>Session 2</b>
Session two was very informative for learning all about variables and expressions. I learned about how functions work and how to prompt the user to input information. Variables are containers that store values, such as let, which is followed by the variable name. A string shows up as text in the browser. While coding my JavaScript, I realized that my function for the age converter program did not function properly because I did not initialize my variables before typing in my commands. This information has very useful for me because I have learned how to collect and process the user input using operators and variables and successfully provided the user with an end result. I hope to use this information in the future to create websites designed to help users with calculating information.
