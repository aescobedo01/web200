Learning JavaScript!

Welcome to my repository! My name is Ana Escobedo and I am taking WEB200 to help deepen my understanding of JavaScript. I am taking this class because I have a learning disability so learning is better for me with an instructor. I hope to use JavaScript to further my knowledge about web development in order to get an associates in science with a focus in web development. Ideally, I would love to be a back-end developer and impliment JavaScript techniques, but I am still considering what potential career options there are. I am excited to learn about how JavaScript makes web pages more interactive. 

<b>Session 2</b>
Session two was very informative for learning all about variables and expressions. I learned about how functions work and how to prompt the user to input information. Variables are containers that store values, such as let, which is followed by the variable name. A string shows up as text in the browser. While coding my JavaScript, I realized that my function for the age converter program did not function properly because I did not initialize my variables before typing in my commands. This information has very useful for me because I have learned how to collect and process the user input using operators and variables and successfully provided the user with an end result. I hope to use this information in the future to create websites designed to help users with calculating information. 

<b>Session 3</b>
<p>
    The lessons learned about functions in JavaScript were extremely helpful. I learned that functions are a set of statements that group together a particular task, it is also a way of organizing and reusing code over and over again. Parameters are the names assigned to the values inside the parenthesis, and should be relevant to whatever data is being held inside the function. The return statement will return the outcome of any data put into the function. For my assignments, I practiced using the return function to show the result of the area of different shapes. This was helpful to my current learning environment because I now understand how to return the results of different calculations.

Additionally, I learned how to use the .toFixed() method to shorten down the decimal notation of the results of my function. This was helpful to my current learning environment because I now understand how to return the results of different calculations.

<b>Session 4</b>
<p>
Lesson 4 was very informative for learning how to use events. An event must be binded to an element and then you must pick the type of event you want to use. The function changeStyle() makes visual changes to a document. I used this particular function with the onclick event to bring up a smiley face with the result when the submit button is clicked. I used both functions on the same line separated by a semicolon to execute both functions at the same time. In activity 5, I learned to use the Math.ceil() object to round my result up to the nearest whole number. This makes sense when rounding up to a whole number when estimating the required amount of yards of flooring. This lesson will be extremely useful to my future learning environment because I comprehend how to build practical websites which show results by using the onclick event, such as using the flooring website to provide the user with the amount of flooring required.

<b>Session 5</b>
<p>
Lesson 5 helped me deepen my understanding of conditions by using the else if statements and expressions using logical and comparison operators. In an if statement, if the condition is true, the code within the curly brackets following the if statement will execute. If the statement is false, it will continue until the condition found within an else statement is true. In my activities using an if else statement, I learned how to take the value of an option in a select form to display the results of the selected option. This was very helpful to my future learning environment because the ability to display the results of the selected option in a form can be useful in a future job. 
</p>

<b>Session 6</b>
<p>
Lesson 6 is about while loops and it has proven to be the most challenging lesson thus far. During this lesson, we learned that while loops test a condition, similar to an if statement. The difference is that in a while loop, if the condition is true, the code is executed, and it will loop around and test condition again. As long as it is a true statement, it will continue being executed. It stops once the statement becomes false. Additionally, I learned that using a break in a while statement will stop the while loop from running anymore. My projects involved using while loops to prompt the user for information and then returning a value by using while loops to calculate the sum of the inputs. I feel that this lesson has deepened my current understanding of JavaScript because these projects were a huge challenge for me.

<b>Session 7</b>
<p>
Lesson 7 was a difficult but rewarding experience. FOR and IF are examples of control flow statements. Control flow statements loop (repeat) and execute code. If else is a conditional statement and can be used to execute a statement if the condition is true. Any values that equate to false will show up as false, undefined, null, 0, NaN, or an empty string. During lesson 7, I was able to work with for loops and nested loops. Nested loops were an extremely difficult challenge but I comprehend how they work better than before this lesson. Additionally, I learned how to use an event listener to call my function without adding JavaScript directly into my HTML. This lesson was very helpful to my current learning environment because I now know how to use for loops and if else statements together. 
</p>

<b>Session 8</b>
<p>
Lesson 8 was challenging but fun. Throughout this lesson, I learned that arrays can be different data types. Additionally, an array can hold a string which is an element in an array. By referring to the index number, you can call the string. When creating my array, I wanted to make sure all of my scores were displayed so I added a string to display them once all of the inputs had been collected from the user. This was very useful to my current learning environment because I now know how to properly store ifnormation given by the user and display it on the webpage. 
</p> 

<b>Session 9</b>
<p>
Lesson 9 was all about challenging myself to create date and time objects. I learned how to use the setInterval object to keep the time updating in real time which was very helpful. Additionally, I learned how to use the DOMContentLoaded event listener to call the function when the page finishes parsing. I also learned how to use getUTCdate to ensure I am using the local date-time and this is helpful to be more accurate when displaying the date. This lesson was very useful to my current learning environment because it helped me to learn new JavaScript techniques to improve my skills for the future.

<b>Session 10</b>
<p>
Lesson 10 was an informative lesson regarding objects in JavaScript. I used the keyword 'this' to set the values in my function to create my Book object. Then, I learned how to use the split method to split the author name and return a concatenated string using the split name to create different formats for citations. The different objects were used to create different MLA and APA book citations. It was helpful to think about using the new objects like reaching into different folders. This lesson was extremely difficult for me but the lessons learned are extremely valuable to me and I will use them in my future learning environment to help process user input. 
</p>

<b>Session 11</b>
<p>
Lesson 11 was about object models which helped through the activities. The browser object model allows the user to access location and screen size. Different types of nodes include document, documenttype, element, text, comments, and documentfragments. In my assignments, I learned to use getElementsByTagName to display all element names on the browser window using a for loop. Additionally, getCurrentPosition method was used to get the user's location through if else statements. I displayed the users location or an error message
if the user did not allow for Geolocation to access their current location. The window size logger updates the current window size when the user resizes the window. This lesson was very helpful to my learning environment because I learned how to display user information in real time. 
</p>

<b>Session 12</b>
<p>
Lesson 12 was learning how to dynamically change HTML using JavaScript. I used dynamic HTML to create a new button using the createElement method and createTextNode to add text to the button. I appended the text node to the button element. I added CSS using the setAttribute method but my page did not load so I learned that 2 arguments are required for it to work, a name and value. Then, I used the location.reload() method to reload the page when clicked. Finally, I used the setAttribute method to disappear the "start here" button when clicked. This lesson has been very useful to my current learning environment because I familiarized myself with new methods to successfully create an element and made it work dynamically in the web browser.
</p>

<b>Session 13 </b>
<p>
Session 13 was about learning how to incorporate dynamic HTML and attributes into a form.
I learned that the GET method attribute should NEVER be used when dealing with sensitive data such as personal information, so I used the POST method attribute when making my form. Additionally, I learned how to use the required attribute to make all input areas required, as well as hhow to add a minimum letter count for each form using the min attribute. This lesson has been very useful to my current JavaScript knowledge because I got the opportunity to study examples of good forms on websites and understand how to use attributes in a form.
