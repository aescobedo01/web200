Learning JavaScript!

Welcome to my repository! My name is Ana Escobedo and I am taking WEB200 to help deepen my understanding of JavaScript. I have a learning disability so learning is better for me with an instructor, which is another reason why I am taking this class. I hope to use JavaScript to further my knowledge about web development in order to get an associates in science with a focus in web development. Ideally, I would love to be a back-end developer and impliment JavaScript techniques, but I am still considering what potential career options there are. I am excited to learn about how JavaScript makes web pages more interactive. 

<b>Session 2</b>
Session two was very informative for learning all about variables and expressions. I learned about how functions work and how to prompt the user to input information. Variables are containers that store values, such as let, which is followed by the variable name. A string shows up as text in the browser. While coding my JavaScript, I realized that my function for the age converter program did not function properly because I did not initialize my variables before typing in my commands. This information has very useful for me because I have learned how to collect and process the user input using operators and variables and successfully provided the user with an end result. I hope to use this information in the future to create websites designed to help users with calculating information. 

<b>Session 3</b>
<p>
    The lessons learned about functions in JavaScript were extremely helpful. I learned that functions are a set of statements that group together a particular task, it is also a way of organizing and reusing code over and over again. Parameters are the names assigned to the values inside the parenthesis, and should be relevant to whatever data is being held inside the function. The return statement will return the outcome of any data put into the function. For my assignments, I practiced using the return function to show the result of the area of different shapes. This was helpful to my current learning environment because I now understand how to return the results of different calculations.

Additionally, I learned how to use the .toFixed() method to shorten down the decimal notation of the results of my function. This was helpful to my current learning environment because I now understand how to return the results of different calculations.

<b>Session 4</b>
<p>
Lesson 4 was very informative for learning how to use events. An event must be binded to an element and then you must pick the type of event you want to use. The function changeStyle() makes visual changes to a document. I used this particular function with the onclick event to bring up a smiley face with the result when the submit button is clicked. I used both functions on the same line separated by a semicolon to execute both functions at the same time. In activity 5, I learned to use the Math.ceil() object to round my result up to the nearest whole number. This makes sense when rounding up to a whole number when estimating the required amount of yards of flooring. This lesson will be extremely useful to my future learning environment because I comprehend how to build practical websites which show results by using the onclick event, such as using the flooring website to provide the user with the amount of flooring required.

<b>Session 5</b>

Lesson 5 helped me deepen my understanding of conditions by using the else if statements and expressions using logical and comparison operators. In an if statement, if the condition is true, the code within the curly brackets following the if statement will execute. If the statement is false, it will continue until the condition found within an else statement is true. In my activities using an if else statement, I learned how to take the value of an option in a select form to display the results of the selected option. This was very helpful to my future learning environment because the ability to display the results of the selected option in a form can be useful in a future job.

<b>Session 6</b>
<p>
Lesson 6 is about while loops and it has proven to be the most challenging lesson thus far. During this lesson, we learned that while loops test a condition, similar to an if statement. The difference is that in a while loop, if the condition is true, the code is executed, and it will loop around and test condition again. As long as it is a true statement, it will continue being executed. It stops once the statement becomes false. Additionally, I learned that using a break in a while statement will stop the while loop from running anymore. My projects involved using while loops to prompt the user for information and then returning a value by using while loops to calculate the sum of the inputs. I feel that this lesson has deepened my current understanding of JavaScript because these projects were a huge challenge for me.

<b>Session 7</b>
<p>
Lesson 7 was a difficult but rewarding experience. FOR and IF are examples of control flow statements. Control flow statements loop (repeat) and execute code. If else is a conditional statement and can be used to execute a statement if the condition is true. Any values that equate to false will show up as false, undefined, null, 0, NaN, or an empty string. During lesson 7, I was able to work with for loops and nested loops. Nested loops were an extremely difficult challenge but I comprehend how they work better than before this lesson. This lesson was very helpful to my current learning environment because I now know how to use for loops and if else statements together.
