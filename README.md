learning javascript!

Welcome to my repository! My name is Ana Escobedo and I am taking WEB200 to help deepen my understanding of JavaScript. I have a learning disability so find that learning is better for me with an instructor, which is another reason why I am taking this class. I hope to use JavaScript to further my knowledge about web development in order to get an associates in science with a focus in web development. Ideally, I would love to be a back-end developer and impliment JavaScript techniques, but I am still considering what potential career options there are. I am excited to learn about how JavaScript makes web pages more interactive.
